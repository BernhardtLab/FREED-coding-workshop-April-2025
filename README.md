# FREED-coding-workshop-April-2025

Repository for the FREED workshop at the University of Guelph (April 5-6) led by the Bernhardt lab

## Why use R and R studio?

Welcome to the Set-Up portion of our FREED R Workshop. This module is modified from the Software Carpentry workshop, which you can learn more about online.

Throughout this module, we're going to teach you some of the fundamentals of the R language as well as some best practices for organizing code for scientific projects.

Although we could use a spreadsheet in Microsoft Excel or Google sheets to analyze our data, these tools are limited in their flexibility and accessibility. Critically, they also are difficult to share steps which explore and change the raw data, which is key to ["reproducible" research](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003285).

Therefore, this workshop will teach you how to begin exploring your data using R and RStudio. The R program is available for Windows, Mac, and Linux operating systems, and is a freely-available where you downloaded it above. To run R, all you need is the R program.

However, to make using R easier, we will use the program RStudio, which we also downloaded above. RStudio is a free, open-source, Integrated Development Environment (IDE). It provides a built-in editor, works on all platforms (including on servers) and provides many advantages such as integration with version control and project management.

## Overview

We will begin with raw data, perform exploratory analyses, and learn how to plot results graphically. This example starts with a dataset from [gapminder.org](https://www.gapminder.org) containing population information for many countries through time. Can you read the data into R? Can you plot the population for Senegal? Can you calculate the average income for countries on the continent of Asia? By the end of these lessons you will be able to do things like plot the populations for all of these countries in under a minute!
