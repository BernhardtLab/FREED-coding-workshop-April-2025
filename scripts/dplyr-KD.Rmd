- To understand how `group_by()` and `summarize()` can be combined to summarize datasets.
- Be able to analyze a subset of data using logical filtering.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: questions
#### Question 

- How can I manipulate data frames without repeating myself?

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: 

First, let's get our environment ready by loading the data and necessary packages. Tidyverse includes dplyr and ggplot2, which we will be using here.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
gapminder <- read.csv("data/gapminder_data.csv", header = TRUE)
library(gapminder)
library(tidyverse)
```

```{r, include=FALSE}
gapminder <- read.csv("data/gapminder_data.csv", header = TRUE)
library(gapminder)
library(tidyverse)
```

Manipulation of data frames means many things to many researchers: we often
select certain observations (rows) or variables (columns), we often group the
data by a certain variable(s), or we even calculate summary statistics. We can
do these operations using the normal base R operations you learned in Jason's segment. 

Let's find the average gdp for each continent in the gapminder dataset. First, view the different continents present in the gapminder dataset.

```{r}
levels(as.factor(gapminder$continent))
```
Quick memory jog -- why do we have to include the `as.factor()` command inside our levels command?

Next, let's take the mean for each continent.

```{r}
mean(gapminder$gdpPercap[gapminder$continent == "Africa"])
mean(gapminder$gdpPercap[gapminder$continent == "Americas"])
mean(gapminder$gdpPercap[gapminder$continent == "Asia"])
mean(gapminder$gdpPercap[gapminder$continent == "Europe"])
mean(gapminder$gdpPercap[gapminder$continent == "Oceania"])
```

But this isn't very *nice* because there is a fair bit of repetition. Imagine doing this for each country in the dataset (there are 142)! Repeating yourself will cost you time, both now and later, and potentially introduce some nasty bugs (did you make any typos while typing out those 5 lines of code?).

## The `dplyr` package

Luckily, the [`dplyr`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=dplyr)
package provides a number of very useful functions for manipulating data frames
in a way that will reduce the above repetition, reduce the probability of making
errors, and probably even save you some typing. As an added bonus, you might
even find the `dplyr` grammar easier to read.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::  tip

#### Tip: Tidyverse
`dplyr` package belongs to a broader family of opinionated R packages
designed for data science called the "Tidyverse". These
packages are specifically designed to work harmoniously together.
Some of these packages will be covered along this course, but you can find more
complete information here: [https://www.tidyverse.org/](https://www.tidyverse.org/).

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::  

Here we're going to cover 5 of the most commonly used functions as well as using
pipes (`%>%`) to combine them.

1. `select()`
2. `filter()`
3. `group_by()`
4. `summarize()`
5. `mutate()`

If you have have not installed this package earlier, please do so:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages('dplyr')
```

Now let's load the package:

```{r, message=FALSE}
library("dplyr")
```

## Using select()

If, for example, we wanted to move forward with only a few of the variables in
our data frame we could use the `select()` function. This will keep only the
variables you select.

```{r}
year_country_gdp <- select(gapminder, year, country, gdpPercap)
```

![](../fig/13-dplyr-fig1.png){alt='Diagram illustrating use of select function to select two columns of a data frame'}

If we want to remove one column only from the `gapminder` data, for example,
removing the `continent` column.

```{r}
smaller_gapminder_data <- select(gapminder, -continent)
```

If we open up `year_country_gdp` we'll see that it only contains the year,
country and gdpPercap, and if we look at the `smaller_gapminder_data` object in the environment, we can see it has one fewer variable than `gapminder,` since we removed the `continent` column.

Above we used 'normal' grammar, where the first argument provides the data frame we are working on and subsequent arguments give the columns to operatre on. But the strengths of
`dplyr` lie in combining several functions using "pipes". Since the pipes grammar
is unlike anything we've seen in R before, let's repeat what we've done above
using pipes.

```{r}
year_country_gdp <- gapminder %>% select(year, country, gdpPercap)
```

To help you understand why we wrote that in that way, let's walk through it step
by step. First we summon the gapminder data frame and pass it on, using the pipe
symbol `%>%`, to the next step, which is the `select()` function. In this case
we don't specify which data object we use in the `select()` function since in
gets that from the previous pipe.

Pipes are very handy and can help you keep your code looking nice and tidy! The keyboard shortcut for adding a pipe is:  `cmd + shift + m` on a mac and `ctrl + shift + m` on a PC.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::  tip

#### Tip: Renaming data frame columns in dplyr

In Chapter 4 we covered how you can rename columns with base R by assigning a value to the output of the `names()` function.
Just like select, this is a bit cumbersome, but thankfully dplyr has a `rename()` function.

Within a pipeline, the syntax is `rename(new_name = old_name)`.
For example, we may want to rename the gdpPercap column name from our `select()` statement above.

```{r}
tidy_gdp <- year_country_gdp %>% rename(gdp_pc = gdpPercap)

head(tidy_gdp)
```

Quick challenge: Why doesn't the rename command require a double equals sign?

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::  

## Using filter()

If we now want to move forward with the above, but only with European
countries, we can combine `select` and `filter`

```{r}
year_country_gdp_euro <- gapminder %>% 
  filter(continent == "Europe") %>% #subset to only countries in Europe
  select(year, country, gdpPercap) #select these three columns only
```
Note how you can use separate lines for different functions, and they are still connected by the pipe symbol. This keeps the code neat, and facilitates helpful annotation placement. The pipe symbol must appear at the end of the line if you use this (very common) notation style.


If we now want to show life expectancy of European countries but only
for a specific year (e.g., 2007), we can do as below.

```{r}
europe_lifeExp_2007 <- gapminder %>%
  filter(continent == "Europe", year == 2007) %>%
  select(country, lifeExp)
```

Here we used a comma to separate multiple conditions we'd like to be true within our `filter()` function. The comma (`,`) operator works exactly the same as the ampersand (`&`) operator in these functions, indicating that both conditions must be true for a row to be included in the resulting, filtered data frame. There is also an "or" operator, the `|` symbol, which is accessed via `shift + backslash`.



:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::  challenge

#### Challenge 1

Write a single command (which can span multiple lines and includes pipes) that
will produce a data frame that has the African values for `lifeExp`, `country`
and `year`, but not for other Continents. How many rows does your data frame
have and why? How else could you check that this worked properly?

<div id="solution-content-14" class="solution">
<h4>Solution to Challenge 1:</h4>

```{r}
year_country_lifeExp_Africa <- gapminder %>%
                           filter(continent == "Africa") %>%
                           select(year, country, lifeExp)

#check
levels(as.factor(year_country_lifeExp_Africa$country)) #this looks correct

```
</div>


:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::  challenge

#### Challenge 2

Now, repeat the exercise above, but include values for `lifeExp`, `country`, and `year` for both Africa and Oceania, but not the other continents. How many rows does this data frame have and why? 
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::  

<input type="checkbox" id="solution-toggle-15" style="display:none;" />
<label for="solution-toggle-15" class="toggle-label">Click to show the solution</label>
<div id="solution-content-15" class="solution">
<h4>Solution to challenge 2:</h4>


```{r}
year_country_lifeExp_Afr_Oce <- gapminder %>% 
  filter(continent == "Africa" | continent == "Oceania") %>% 
  select(year, country, lifeExp)

#check
levels(as.factor(year_country_lifeExp_Afr_Oce$country)) #this looks correct
```
</div>


As with last time, first we pass the gapminder data frame to the `filter()`
function, then we pass the filtered version of the gapminder data frame to the
`select()` function. **Note:** The order of operations is very important in this
case. If we used 'select' first, filter would not be able to find the variable
`continent` since we would have removed it in the previous step.


## Using group\_by()

Now, we were supposed to be reducing the error prone repetitiveness of what can
be done with base R, but up to now we haven't done that since we would have to
repeat the above for each continent. Instead of `filter()`, which will only pass
observations that meet your criteria (in the above: `continent=="Europe"`), we
can use `group_by()`, which will essentially use every unique criteria (i.e. level) that you
could have used in filter.

```{r}
str(gapminder)

str(gapminder %>% group_by(continent))
```

You will notice that the structure of the data frame where we used `group_by()`
(`grouped_df`) is not the same as the original `gapminder` (`data.frame`). A
`grouped_df` can be thought of as a `list` where each item in the `list`is a
`data.frame` which contains only the rows that correspond to the a particular
value `continent` (at least in the example above).

![](../fig/13-dplyr-fig2.png){alt='Diagram illustrating how the group by function oraganizes a data frame into groups'}

## Using summarize()

The above was a bit on the uneventful side but `group_by()` is much more
exciting in conjunction with `summarize()`. This will allow us to create new
variable(s) by using functions that repeat for each of the continent-specific
data frames. That is to say, using the `group_by()` function, we split our
original data frame into multiple pieces, then we can run functions
(e.g. `mean()` or `sd()`) within `summarize()`.

Let's calculate the mean gdp for each continent, like we did at the top of this lesson, but using `group_by()` and `summarize()`
```{r}
gdp_bycontinents <- gapminder %>%
    group_by(continent) %>%
    summarize(mean_gdpPercap = mean(gdpPercap))
```

![](../fig/13-dplyr-fig3.png){alt='Diagram illustrating the use of group by and summarize together to create a new variable'}

```{r, eval=FALSE}
continent mean_gdpPercap
     <fctr>          <dbl>
1    Africa       2193.755
2  Americas       7136.110
3      Asia       7902.150
4    Europe      14469.476
5   Oceania      18621.609
```

That allowed us to calculate the mean gdpPercap for each continent, but it gets
even better.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::  challenge

#### Challenge 3

1. Calculate the average life expectancy per country. 
2. Use `filter()` to determine which country has the longest average life expectancy and which has the shortest average life expectancy?
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::  

<input type="checkbox" id="solution-toggle-16" style="display:none;" />
<label for="solution-toggle-16" class="toggle-label">Click to show the solution</label>
<div id="solution-content-16" class="solution">
<h4>Solution to challenge 3:</h4>

```{r}
lifeExp_bycountry <- gapminder %>%
   group_by(country) %>%
   summarize(mean_lifeExp = mean(lifeExp))

lifeExp_bycountry %>%
   filter(mean_lifeExp == min(mean_lifeExp) | mean_lifeExp == max(mean_lifeExp))
```

Another way to do this is to use the `dplyr` function `arrange()`, which
arranges the rows in a data frame according to the order of one or more
variables from the data frame.  It has similar syntax to other functions from
the `dplyr` package. You can use `desc()` inside `arrange()` to sort in
descending order.

```{r}
lifeExp_bycountry %>%
   arrange(mean_lifeExp) %>% #default arrangement is ascending order
   head(1) #just give the first row

lifeExp_bycountry %>%
   arrange(desc(mean_lifeExp)) %>%
   head(1) 
```

Alphabetical order works too

```{r}
lifeExp_bycountry %>%
   arrange(desc(country)) %>%
   head()
```
</div>

The function `group_by()` allows us to group by multiple variables. Let's group by `year` and `continent`.

```{r}
gdp_bycontinents_byyear <- gapminder %>%
    group_by(continent, year) %>% 
    summarize(mean_gdpPercap = mean(gdpPercap))
```

That is already quite powerful, but it gets even better! You're not limited to defining 1 new variable in `summarize()`.

```{r}
gdp_pop_bycontinents_byyear <- gapminder %>%
    group_by(continent, year) %>%
    summarize(mean_gdpPercap = mean(gdpPercap),
              sd_gdpPercap = sd(gdpPercap),
              mean_pop = mean(pop),
              sd_pop = sd(pop))
```

## count() and n()

A very common operation is to count the number of observations for each
group. The `dplyr` package comes with two related functions that help with this.

For instance, if we wanted to check the number of countries included in the
dataset for the year 2002, we can use the `count()` function. It takes the name
of one or more columns that contain the groups we are interested in, and we can
optionally sort the results in descending order by adding `sort=TRUE`:

```{r}
gapminder %>%
    filter(year == 2002) %>%
    count(continent, sort = TRUE)
```

If we need to use the number of observations in calculations, the `n()` function
is useful. It will return the total number of observations in the current group rather than counting the number of observations in each group within a specific column. For instance, if we wanted to get the standard error of the life expectancy per continent:

```{r}
gapminder %>%
    group_by(continent) %>%
    summarize(se_le = sd(lifeExp)/sqrt(n()))
```

You can also chain together several summary operations; in this case calculating the `minimum`, `maximum`, `mean` and `se` of each continent's per-country life-expectancy:

```{r}
gapminder %>%
    group_by(continent) %>%
    summarize(
      mean_le = mean(lifeExp),
      min_le = min(lifeExp),
      max_le = max(lifeExp),
      se_le = sd(lifeExp)/sqrt(n()))
```

## Using mutate()

We can also create new variables prior to (or even after) summarizing information using `mutate()`.

```{r}
gdp_pop_bycontinents_byyear <- gapminder %>%
    mutate(gdp_billion = gdpPercap*pop/10^9) %>%
    group_by(continent,year) %>%
    summarize(mean_gdpPercap = mean(gdpPercap),
              sd_gdpPercap = sd(gdpPercap),
              mean_pop = mean(pop),
              sd_pop = sd(pop),
              mean_gdp_billion = mean(gdp_billion),
              sd_gdp_billion = sd(gdp_billion))
```

## Connect mutate with logical filtering: ifelse

When creating new variables, we can hook this with a logical condition. A simple combination of
`mutate()` and `ifelse()` facilitates filtering right where it is needed: in the moment of creating something new. This easy-to-read statement is a fast and powerful way of discarding certain data (even though the overall dimension of the data frame will not change) or for updating values depending on this given condition.

Let's calculate the gdp per billion people, only for people with a life expectancy greater than 25, and store that value in a new column
```{r}
gdp_pop_bycontinents_byyear_above25 <- gapminder %>%
    mutate(gdp_billion = ifelse(lifeExp > 25, gdpPercap * pop / 10^9, NA)) 
```
Let's break that down. `mutate` builds a new column, with name `gdp_billion`. Inside our `ifelse` statement, we first list the condition for a given observation -- here our condition is "life expectancy of this country in this year is over 25 years". Then, we tell R what to put in the `gdp_billion` column if that condition is met, here the calculation, then what to put in the `gdp_billion` column if that condition is not met, here `NA`.

Now, let's summarize that information, along with `gdpPercap` and `pop`, by country and year.
```{r}
gdp_pop_bycontinents_byyear_above25 <- gapminder %>% 
    mutate(gdp_billion = ifelse(lifeExp > 25, gdpPercap * pop / 10^9, NA)) %>% 
    group_by(continent, year) %>%
    summarize(mean_gdpPercap = mean(gdpPercap),
              sd_gdpPercap = sd(gdpPercap),
              mean_pop = mean(pop),
              sd_pop = sd(pop),
              mean_gdp_billion = mean(gdp_billion),
              sd_gdp_billion = sd(gdp_billion))
```

## Combining `dplyr` and `ggplot2`

In the plotting lesson we looked at how to make a multi-panel figure by adding
a layer of facet panels using `ggplot2`. Here is the code we used (with some
extra comments):

```{r}
# Filter countries located in the Americas
americas <- gapminder[gapminder$continent == "Americas", ]

# Make the plot
ggplot(data = americas, mapping = aes(x = year, y = lifeExp)) +
  geom_line() +
  facet_wrap( ~ country) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45))
```

This code makes the right plot but it also creates an intermediate variable
(`americas`) that we might not have any other uses for. Just as we used
`%>%` to pipe data along a chain of `dplyr` functions we can use it to pass data
to `ggplot()`. Because `%>%` replaces the first argument in a function we don't
need to specify the `data =` argument in the `ggplot()` function. By combining
`dplyr` and `ggplot2` functions we can make the same figure without creating any
new variables or modifying the data.

```{r}
gapminder %>% 
  filter(continent == "Americas") %>% # Filter countries located in the Americas
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = year, y = lifeExp)) + # Make the plot
  geom_line() +
  facet_wrap( ~ country) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45))
```

More examples of using the function `mutate()` and the `ggplot2` package.

```{r}
gapminder %>%
  mutate(startsWith = substr(country, 1, 1)) %>%  # extract first letter of country name into new column
  filter(startsWith %in% c("A", "Z")) %>% # only keep countries starting with A or Z
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = lifeExp, colour = continent)) + # plot lifeExp into facets
  geom_line() +
  facet_wrap(~country) +
  theme_minimal()
```

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::  challenge

#### Challenge 4

Make a graph that shows how population size has changed through time in each country that begins with the same letter as your given name (unless your first name begins with "X" or "Q", in which case, try your surname!). Colour the data by whether or not you were born yet (hint: create a new variable that does this using the `mutate` and `ifelse` functions). Use facets to display each country separately. 

Bonus: Look up `labs`, `shape`, `linetype`, `theme`, or `facet_grid` in the ggplot2 documentation and add one more degree of customization to your graph!
